# Prerequisites

## Node and NPM 

We use a version manager so as to allow concurrent versions of node and other software.  [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) is recommended.  asdf uses a config file called .tool-versions that the reshim command picks up so that all collaborators are using the same versions.

Run the following commands:
```
asdf plugin-add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
```

Next open .tool-versions and take the node version there and use it in the following command so that that specific version of node is present on your local machine for asdf to switch to.  Replace the "x" characters in the following command with what's in .tool-versions.

```
asdf install nodejs x.xx.x
```

Then run the following commands every time you need to switch npm versions in a project.

```
asdf reshim nodejs
npm i -g yarn
yarn install
```

## Install [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/)

**Note, use `angular/cli`. Do not use `angular/angular-cli`**.

```
npm i -g @angular/cli
```

`ng` is the CLI itself .

**Verify the installation**

```
npm list -g @angular/cli --depth=0
ng -v
```

## Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#alternatives-tab)

```
npm i -g yarn
```

# Fork, Build and Run

1. After installing Node and Yarn, you can fork or straight download a copy of this application to start your own app.
1. First download all the dependencies with `yarn install`.
1. Run `npm start` to start the webpack server to run the application on port 4300.

    Go to http://localhost:4300 to verify that the application is running.

    :bulb: To change the default port, open `.angular-cli.json`, change the value on `defaults.serve.port`.
    
1. Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build, like so: `ng serve --prod` to run in production mode.
1. Run `npm run lint` to lint your app code using `TSLint`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

### Example: Generate a customer component

```
ng g c customer
```

### Example: Generate a directive: search-box

```
ng g d search-box
```

### Example: Generate a service: general-data

```
ng g s general-data
```

Angular will give out a warning line after this command:

> WARNING Service is generated but not provided, it must be provided to be used

After generating a service, we must go to its owning module and add the service to the `providers` array.

### Example: Generate a service and include it in a module automatically

```
ng g s general-data2 -m app.module
```

### Example: Generate a class, an interface and enum

```
# class
ng g cl models/customer

# interface
ng g i models/person

# enum
ng g enum models/gender
```

### Example: Generate a pipe

```
ng g pipe shared/init-caps
```

## Generate a module

Create a login directory and generate a login module in that directory.

```
ng g module login/login.module
```

## Add/Generate Routing Features

Generate a module called admin and add routing feature to it.

```
ng g module admin --routing
```

## Running Tests

### Unit tests
  
Set up via Karma, Jasmine:
1. Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### End-to-end tests

Set up with Protractor:
1. Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
1. Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Change aspects of the application

### Change style dialect

```
ng set default.styleExt css
```

## Regenerate a brand new project with routing and scss options

```
ng new my-app --routing --style scss
```

## Getting Help

1. To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
1. `ng doc component` to look up documentation for features.
1. `ng serve --help` to look up doc for `ng serve` command.

<!-- # Build and Deployment

For dev, test, and production builds on OpenShift/Jenkins see [openshift/README.md](https://github.com/bcgov/eagle-public/blob/master/openshift/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to setup in an OpenShift environment using nginx.
