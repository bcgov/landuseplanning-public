			<h2>About this site</h2>
			<p>As of October 15, 2018, Crown land applications that are open for public commenting will be posted on this website. If you are looking for an application posted prior to October 15, 2018 please refer to the <a href="https://arfd.gov.bc.ca/" target="_blank">Applications and Reasons for Decision</a> website. This website is used to post Crown land application information for public review and comment, as per Section 32(2) of the <em>Land Act</em>.</p>
			<p>Crown land is land (or land covered by water, such as rivers or lakes) that is available for public use for many different purposes - from industry, to recreation and research. Government is currently responsible for granting land-use access to this land in consultation with First Nations and members of the public. To make an application for use of Crown land, visit the <a href="https://portal.nrs.gov.bc.ca/web/client/home" target="_blank">Natural Resource Online Services</a> website.</p>
